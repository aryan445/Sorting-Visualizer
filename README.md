The Sorting Visualizer is a web-based tool designed to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work through visual animations. It allows users to see the step-by-step process of sorting data using popular algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and more.

# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This project is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work by visualizing the sorting process in real-time. It provides a graphical representation of various sorting algorithms, allowing users to see how elements are compared, swapped, and arranged into order.

# Features:
1-Real-time Visualization: Displays the step-by-step process of sorting algorithms.
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Includes a variety of algorithms such as:
Bubble Sort
Heap Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
2-Customizable Input: Users can input array sizes and values or generate random arrays of different lengths.
3-Control Speed: Adjust the speed of the visualizations to observe fast or slow sorting.
4-Interactive UI: Simple and intuitive user interface built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Algorithm Implementations: Each algorithm is implemented in JavaScript and can be visualized step-by-step.

# Project Goals:
To provide a tool for understanding how sorting algorithms work internally.
To demonstrate the efficiency and time complexity of various sorting techniques through real-time animations.

# How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Open index.html in a browser.
Select a sorting algorithm and customize the array size and speed.
Watch the algorithm in action as the array is sorted visually!

# Future Improvements:
Add more sorting algorithms (e.g., Heap Sort, Radix Sort).
Implement additional features such as a step-by-step walkthrough and comparison of algorithm efficiencies.
